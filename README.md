# Hephaistos Importer for Obsidian.md

For the Starfinder RPG.

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) allowing for import of characters from [Hephaistos](https://hephaistos.online).

It is completely unaffiliated with either program and all thanks go to the dedicated programmers of those.

## Features

Given the public ID for a number of Hephaistos characters (the number at the end of the public share link), clicking on the **anvil** icon will populate the selected Obsidian folder with a note for each character, filling the frontmatter with data from Hephaistos, such as:

```
name: Mila Imarin
hephaistos link: https://hephaistos.online/character/779575002
abilities:
  - strength: 10
  - dexterity: 14
  - constitution: 12
  - intelligence: 15
  - wisdom: 10
  - charisma: 21
race: Human
classes:
  - Witchwarper: 5
```

etc.

If there is already a note with a character's name, the plugin wil update the frontmatter while leaving the rest of the note untouched.

Frontmatter will only be updated, not replaced. If you have other frontmatter entries, such as `cssclasses`, those will remain unaffected by the plugin.

### Hyperlinks

_Enabled in settings_.

Some fields, such as spell names, can be created either as plain text or Obsidian hyperlinks.

The links are based on the [Community SRD vault](https://github.com/Obsidian-TTRPG-Community/Starfinder-SRD-Markdown)'s structure, but since the vault is very complex, the plugin may guess wrong when trying to create a link path.

### Initiative Tracker compatibility

_Enabled in settings_.

The importer can generate fields compatible with [Javalent's Initiative Tracker](https://github.com/javalent/initiative-tracker).
These are:

-   **level**: total level
-   **hp**: sum of current health, current stamina, and temporary hp
-   **ac** text with `EAC X, KAC Y`
-   **modifier**: initiative modifier

### Fantasy Statblocks compatibility

_Enabled in settings_.

The importer can format fields to work with [Javalent's Fantasy Statblocks](https://github.com/javalent/fantasy-statblocks).

A simple statblock file, modified from [TheNightMayor](https://github.com/TheNightMayor)'s Starfinder bestiary layout, can be found [here](assets/starfinder-character-layout.json).

## Installation

Install via the Obsidian Community Plug-ins.

### Manual installation

Create a folder in your obsidian vault's `.obsidian/plugins/` folder and download the `main.js`and `manifest.json` files from the latest github release into it. You can find the latest Github release under `Releases` to the right on the plugin's github page.

## Limitations

This plugin is _not_ intended to replace Hephaistos in any way. It is merely importing the most important data for convenience's sake -- probably most useful for Game Masters.

## Known issues

The plugin utilizes a feature implemented in Hephaistos on the 3rd of February 2025. It will fail to import characters who haven't been saved since then. To update a character, simply appply a point of damage and remove it again.

## Future

I want to keep this plugin compatible with other relevant Starfinder projects and Obsidian plugins or templates/styles. Please bring any to my knowledge.

## Contact

Bug reports and feature requests are very welcome. How do you use the plugin? Can I make it better for you?
